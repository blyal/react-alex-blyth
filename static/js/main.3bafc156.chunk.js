Simon Baker is an absolute star. He really holds your attention well, his delivery and demeanour are excellent, and he really brings the character to life. Pay attention for the very rare but definite moments where his Australian accent slips through. Also would give a shout out to the actors of Teresa Lisbon (Jane\u2019s boss) and Kimball Cho. Robin Tunney plays one of the cutest homicide detectives I\u2019ve ever seen, is very emotionally engaging, and Tim Kang\u2019s Cho is an extremely funny deadpan and badass performance.

There is usually some bureaucratic matter at play in the background of their division, the California Bureau of Investigation (which is actually one of the show\u2019s strengths, as it shows how the politics of law enforcement and government agencies can affect the course-of-duty). The show introduces a series of possible candidates for the murder, and Jane always inconceivably manages to unmask the perpetrator, who is usually the not\u2013obvious choice.

As smart as Jane is, and as well as he is able to read people and situations, Red John is always one step ahead, and Jane is always looking for creative ways to gain the upper hand. There were about two or three \u2018Red John\u2019 episodes every season, until the fifth and sixth seasons where the intensity heightens as Jane closes in on Red John\u2019s true identity (so luckily the formula goes on hiatus for a few episodes between seasons 5 and 6)."),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"code-blog-entry-content-img"},o.a.createElement("figure",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:"images/mentalist-redjohn.jpg",alt:"The Red John symbol from The Mentalist",height:"100%",width:"100%"}),o.a.createElement("figcaption",null,"The haunting face drawn by Red John in his victims' blood.

Jane used to pretend to be a psychic, but basically what he is is a psychoanalyst for hire. He has an extraordinary understanding of human psychology, understands that the patterns of the past play out in the present in human behaviour, and uses that understanding to profile people associated with a murder investigation, as well as to play with and occasionally manipulate the people around him at work. Co-workers at the CBI often take offence to Jane\u2019s arrogance (apart from those in his team, who love him), but anyone who tries to undermine him or diminish him ends up playing the price, as Jane is far too clever at setting traps for people, or else giving them the rope to hang themselves with (not literally). For all his manipulation, though, Jane is a good guy \u2014 the only person he wishes genuine harm towards, except for the occasional psychopath he might encounter in his line of work, is Red John. And that is the most intriguing thing: Jane is able to psychoanalyse people extremely effectively, but he has a very limited ability to address his own inner turmoil. He cannot let go of the guilt he feels for the death of his family, and rather than addressing the emotions and pain \u2014 rather than working through and letting go of his pain \u2014 he chases and wishes to kill Red John as an attempt to eliminate the pain, therefore living inside his trauma every day. It guides his reality. On the one hand, that\u2019s good because he is ridding the world of a vicious killer. On the other hand, it\u2019s terrible from the perspective of personal mental wellbeing.

I had known about it for a lot longer, as I learned to program mainly using JavaScript and naturally gravitated towards Front\u2013End Development. I therefore heard pretty soon about the advantages that Single Page Application libraries provide, and React is king of the SPAs in terms of usage. During my time at Virsae I was programming using Angular, which I found very satisfactory to use, but I had heard much talk from people who preferred React, including one of the guys I worked with. I knew enough about Angular by this stage to start wondering about the ways in which React was different, and I felt it could only benefit me in the long\u2013term to diversify my knowledge of Front\u2013End libraries rather than limit myself to one. A short time later, during the CoVid-19 lockdown and my months of job\u2013searching, I finally had plenty of time to dedicate to learning React, and you\u2019re looking at the result! I had wanted to build a personal website for a while, to share my coding projects, blog, and general things I\u2019m interested in, as well as to display my interests and personality. As such, I decided to code the project using React, killing two birds with one stone by using this as a learning opportunity."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"My first port of call for learning React were the free tutorials on YouTube, including ",o.a.createElement("a",{onClick:function(e){return e.stopPropagation()},target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",className:"cyan",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A"},"this brilliant one")," by Traversy Media, which covers all the fundamentals of React. From this course I first learnt about component structure, JSX, state, props, and React Routing. YouTube has some really helpful courses created by very talented programming teachers such as Brad Traversy. In coordination with such free content, there are lots of subscription\u2013service websites which have programming courses on them. I like to use ",o.a.createElement("a",{onClick:function(e){return e.stopPropagation()},target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",className:"cyan",href:"https://www.codecademy.com/"},"codecademy")," (which I also used to learn React) because all the learning is practical with their service, so as soon as you learn a concept you have to demonstrate that you can use it.

These components include a Blog component, a Code component, a Now component, a Film component, a Cool Stuff component, and a homepage component \u2014 basically all the links you can see in the navigation menu, aside from the homepage component which is accessed by clicking my name at the top of the page. Some of these components also have subcomponents which can be accessed by clicking different elements of the component page \u2014 such as the different coding projects on this coding page component.

I wanted to share the site with friends and colleagues on my social media pages, but beforehand I decided to conduct some user testing, which was probably the best idea I had.

I\u2019m very sure this is true now, because this is definitely one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019ve never read a book that so perfectly captures the experience of growing up, from both the personal perspective, as well as the perspective of someone embedded in a friend group, as well as embedded in a community. When you read My Brilliant Friend, you\u2019ll surely have multiple \u201cthat\u2019s so true!\u201d moments, that maybe make you reflect on your own childhood from a new position. This is the effect of the story, told as it is from a retrospective narratorial position of an older woman reflecting and recalling her experience of growing up in 1950s Italy, alongside her best friend \u2014 the enigmatic, proud, dominant, and brilliant Lila.","Lila and Len\xfa, the main character, have a strange relationship \u2014 though I guess most relationships are probably stranger than they seem on the surface. This story covers the journey of their friendship from childhood to late adolescence, and in doing so uncovers the effect that our friends have on us as we develop, as well as the effect that the nature of our surrounding community has on us, as well as the fundamental biological changes that we undergo. Although this book isn\u2019t exactly fun, its 'truth' caused a lot of things to make sense to me in ways they previously hadn\u2019t. A lot of tough things happen during childhood and adolescence! We are at the mercy of the structure of our community, we undergo disorienting physical and emotional changes, and the way people treat us and the way we feel about other people is constantly changing.","Lila and Len\xfa\u2019s very competitive-yet-devoted friendship helps to get them through these tough times, but it also underscores the fact that underneath every friendship and every friend group are a set of dimensions among which we are constantly assessing ourselves and others relative to each other, and making evaluations of relative status. This book makes the case that these status evaluations are mediated by perception, and therefore are open to conscious interference \u2014 as when Lila downplays the importance of school, for example (when her family does not allow her to continue studying, where Len\xfa\u2019s family does), and begins to emphasise the importance of her family\u2019s shoemaking profession. However, the book also demonstrates that the fact that we do make these spontaneous evaluations of status means that our capacity and proclivity to make these judgements is built into the fundamental nature of our being, and is a primary motivating psychological force. Lila and Len\xfa are comparing and competing from the moment where they are young children, competing to see which of them will succumb to fear first, and their status\u2013consciousness continues until the end of the book with Len\xfa\u2019s scrutinising, along with the rest of their community, of Lila\u2019s relationship with one of the neighbourhood\u2019s very high-status men.","Although the book\u2019s title may not be as simple as it appears, Lila is certainly Len\xfa\u2019s brilliant friend. Their constant competing pushes them both to higher and higher achievement (as always, achievement relative to their peers and eventually to the wider community), and Lila\u2019s hunger to constantly achieve and attain more catapults her to further and further attainment throughout her life, along with the difficulties that come along with attainment. It\u2019s a fascinating and enlightening read, and there\u2019s too much to say about it, so for now I\u2019ll just say that you should put down whatever you\u2019re currently reading and order a copy of this book."],related:[{title:"The Secret History",author:"Donna Tartt",image:o.a.createElement("img",{alt:"The Secret History",src:"images/the-secret-history.jpg",className:"book-sh",height:"30%",width:"30%"})},{title:"Persuasion",author:"Jane Austen",image:o.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Persuasion",src:"images/persuasion.jpg",className:"book-pers",height:"30%",width:"30%"})},{title:"Boyhood",year:"(2014)",author:"directed by Richard Linklater",image:o.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Boyhood",src:"images/boyhood.jpg",className:"boyhood-pic",height:"32.5%",width:"32.5%"})}]},{title:"American Psycho",author:"Bret Easton Ellis",id:Object(P.a)(),mainImage:o.a.createElement("img",{src:"images/american-psycho.jpg",alt:"American Psycho",height:"234",width:"152.7"}),paragraphs:["Disclaimer \u2014 not for the faint\u2013hearted or easily\u2013offended.

In fact, my personal conviction is that the darkest shit is the shit we need to deal with the most. If you look straight at something that, not just makes you scared, but horrifies you, you\u2019re stronger for it.","American Psycho is a fascinating reflection on the masks we wear in society, the nature of the modern capitalist social environment, the pain we hide within us, and the damage it is capable of causing if it escapes our attempts to contain it. Outside of that, American Psycho is a hilarious deadpan comedy, which might sound a little strange, but for the first half of the book it\u2019s hard to call it anything other than a comedy. Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s minimalism is stylistically perfect, and the wit it delivers is dynamite, Also, many of the narrative ideas of the book are comedy gold \u2014 the characters all looking so alike that they fail to tell each other apart, for example. Then the book plunges into the darkness.","I admire Ellis \u2014 having the courage and the daring to publish something like this is quite something. Humans are capable of some very dangerous stuff.

Scorsese knows how to excite an audience, how to get their hearts pounding (you can definitely see a bit of where Tarantino got his inspiration). His films don\u2019t really follow conventional narrative structures, but usually explore a person or group as their lives go on (whether it\u2019s gangsters in New York, Taxi Drivers in New York, boxers in New York, Jesus Christ, stockbrokers in New York\u2026 it\u2019s usually in New York).

His films usually involve Owen Wilson and/or Bill Murray feeling a bit meaningless in life, working through a family\u2013 or career\u2013related problem. Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson actually went to university together, and began their film careers together. Though he started writing with Wilson, and although he still closely collaborates with other writers, Wes has evolved into a auteur star director. The dialogue in his films is razor\u2013sharp, the directing style is so unique that it\u2019s worth the price of admission alone just to witness, and his actors always give amazing performances.
