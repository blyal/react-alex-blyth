Simon Baker is an absolute star. He really holds your attention well, his delivery and demeanour are excellent, and he really brings the character to life. Pay attention for the very rare but definite moments where his Australian accent slips through. Also would give a shout out to the actors of Teresa Lisbon (Jane\u2019s boss) and Kimball Cho. Robin Tunney plays one of the cutest homicide detectives I\u2019ve ever seen, is very emotionally engaging, and Tim Kang\u2019s Cho is an extremely funny deadpan and badass performance.

There is usually some bureaucratic matter at play in the background of their division, the California Bureau of Investigation (which is actually one of the show\u2019s strengths, as it shows how the politics of law enforcement and government agencies can affect the course-of-duty).

He has an extraordinary understanding of human psychology, understands that the patterns of the past play out in the present in human behaviour, and uses that understanding to profile people associated with a murder investigation, as well as to play with and occasionally manipulate the people around him at work. Co-workers at the CBI often take offence to Jane\u2019s arrogance (apart from those in his team, who love him), but anyone who tries to undermine him or diminish him ends up playing the price, as Jane is far too clever at setting traps for people, or else giving them the rope to hang themselves with (not literally). For all his manipulation, though, Jane is a good guy \u2014 the only person he wishes genuine harm towards, except for the occasional psychopath he might encounter in his line of work, is Red John. And that is the most intriguing thing: Jane is able to psychoanalyse people extremely effectively, but he has a very limited ability to address his own inner turmoil. He cannot let go of the guilt he feels for the death of his family, and rather than addressing the emotions and pain \u2014 rather than working through and letting go of his pain \u2014 he chases and wishes to kill Red John as an attempt to eliminate the pain, therefore living inside his trauma every day.

Furthermore, this is actually oftentimes what interviewers are primarily looking for \u2014 to see if you are the kind of person they can connect with. Usually they\u2019ve already seen your qualifications on your CV, so when they ask you questions, they\u2019re really just trying to gauge you as a person, to see if you are the kind of person they and/or their colleagues would enjoy working alongside.

You may have to tweak this point based on your personality: if you\u2019re the kind of person who doesn\u2019t usually give yourself much credit, you should practice writing down the relevant things you are proud of about yourself, and be prepared to talk about them when asked. However, if self\u2013confidence is not really a problem for you, then your concern should be to make sure that you don\u2019t brag too much in the interview and/or give off the vibe that you\u2019ll probably be running the company in a couple of years.

I had known about it for a lot longer, as I learned to program mainly using JavaScript and naturally gravitated towards Front\u2013End Development.

During my time at Virsae I was programming using Angular, which I found very satisfactory to use, but I had heard much talk from people who preferred React, including one of the guys I worked with. I knew enough about Angular by this stage to start wondering about the ways in which React was different, and I felt it could only benefit me in the long\u2013term to diversify my knowledge of Front\u2013End libraries rather than limit myself to one.

I\u2019m very sure this is true now, because this is definitely one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019ve never read a book that so perfectly captures the experience of growing up, from both the personal perspective, as well as the perspective of someone embedded in a friend group, as well as embedded in a community. When you read My Brilliant Friend, you\u2019ll surely have multiple \u201cthat\u2019s so true!\u201d moments, that maybe make you reflect on your own childhood from a new position. This is the effect of the story, told as it is from a retrospective narratorial position of an older woman reflecting and recalling her experience of growing up in 1950s Italy, alongside her best friend \u2014 the enigmatic, proud, dominant, and brilliant Lila.","Lila and Len\xfa, the main character, have a strange relationship \u2014 though I guess most relationships are probably stranger than they seem on the surface. This story covers the journey of their friendship from childhood to late adolescence, and in doing so uncovers the effect that our friends have on us as we develop, as well as the effect that the nature of our surrounding community has on us, as well as the fundamental biological changes that we undergo. Although this book isn\u2019t exactly fun, its 'truth' caused a lot of things to make sense to me in ways they previously hadn\u2019t. A lot of tough things happen during childhood and adolescence! We are at the mercy of the structure of our community, we undergo disorienting physical and emotional changes, and the way people treat us and the way we feel about other people is constantly changing.","Lila and Len\xfa\u2019s very competitive-yet-devoted friendship helps to get them through these tough times, but it also underscores the fact that underneath every friendship and every friend group are a set of dimensions among which we are constantly assessing ourselves and others relative to each other, and making evaluations of relative status. This book makes the case that these status evaluations are mediated by perception, and therefore are open to conscious interference \u2014 as when Lila downplays the importance of school, for example (when her family does not allow her to continue studying, where Len\xfa\u2019s family does), and begins to emphasise the importance of her family\u2019s shoemaking profession. However, the book also demonstrates that the fact that we do make these spontaneous evaluations of status means that our capacity and proclivity to make these judgements is built into the fundamental nature of our being, and is a primary motivating psychological force. Lila and Len\xfa are comparing and competing from the moment where they are young children, competing to see which of them will succumb to fear first, and their status\u2013consciousness continues until the end of the book with Len\xfa\u2019s scrutinising, along with the rest of their community, of Lila\u2019s relationship with one of the neighbourhood\u2019s very high-status men.","Although the book\u2019s title may not be as simple as it appears, Lila is certainly Len\xfa\u2019s brilliant friend. Their constant competing pushes them both to higher and higher achievement (as always, achievement relative to their peers and eventually to the wider community), and Lila\u2019s hunger to constantly achieve and attain more catapults her to further and further attainment throughout her life, along with the difficulties that come along with attainment. It\u2019s a fascinating and enlightening read, and there\u2019s too much to say about it, so for now I\u2019ll just say that you should put down whatever you\u2019re currently reading and order a copy of this book."],related:[{title:"The Secret History",author:"Donna Tartt",image:o.a.createElement("img",{alt:"The Secret History",src:"images/the-secret-history.jpg",className:"book-sh",height:"30%",width:"30%"})},{title:"Persuasion",author:"Jane Austen",image:o.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Persuasion",src:"images/persuasion.jpg",className:"book-pers",height:"30%",width:"30%"})},{title:"Boyhood",year:"(2014)",author:"directed by Richard Linklater",image:o.a.createElement("img",{alt:"Boyhood",src:"images/boyhood.jpg",className:"boyhood-pic",height:"32.5%",width:"32.5%"})}]},{title:"American Psycho",author:"Bret Easton Ellis",id:Object(H.a)(),mainImage:o.a.createElement("img",{src:"images/american-psycho.jpg",alt:"American Psycho",height:"234",width:"152.7"}),paragraphs:["Disclaimer \u2014 not for the faint\u2013hearted or easily\u2013offended.

Outside of that, American Psycho is a hilarious deadpan comedy, which might sound a little strange, but for the first half of the book it\u2019s hard to call it anything other than a comedy. Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s minimalism is stylistically perfect, and the wit it delivers is dynamite, Also, many of the narrative ideas of the book are comedy gold \u2014 the characters all looking so alike that they fail to tell each other apart, for example. Then the book plunges into the darkness.","I admire Ellis \u2014 having the courage and the daring to publish something like this is quite something. Humans are capable of some very dangerous stuff.
