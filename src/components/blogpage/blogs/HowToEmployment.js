                Before finishing university, it’s easy to fall into one of two naïve mindsets regarding your impending post–student existence. The first is “I’ll easily get a job — there’s nothing to worry about”, and the second is “I’ll never find a job. This is hopeless”. I was much closer to the first one. I finished university in June 2020, on exchange in Europe, after which my plan was to travel for a while before just ending up in Spain with a good job. It seemed so straightforward in my mind, even in spite of the pandemic that was happening all around me, which had already crushed my back–up plan, bartending, by closing down all the restaurants and bars.

                Looking back, I really had no right to be so self–assured, but my naïve optimism actually served me well, as it committed me to the project of getting a job in Spain and took me up to and well into the job application process without much anxiety. However, I severely underestimated the situation. At university I had taken my education seriously, but the work needed to get a job doesn’t finish with the end of your degree. To join a good company, there’s a lot more stuff you need to do. However, the silver lining is that you <em>can do it</em>. In my case, after months of searching, literally hundreds of applications, and a number of interviews that I lost count of, I finally did get the perfect job that I was looking for, so perfect for me that it’s almost hard to believe, especially considering all the rejections I got (actually most of which being for worse jobs than the one I eventually got). During my experience I learned some valuable things about how to handle this transition period, which I’m going to share here for anyone who is or will be in the future going through this process.

                    <li><strong>Realise that it might take time.</strong>  Don’t put pressure on yourself to find a job right away. It will take as long as it takes, and that could be a week, or six months, or more. Finding a job can be seen as a process, a system that you have to learn to navigate, so keep hope alive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don’t take rejection to heart.</strong> If a company doesn’t choose you for the job, do not take it personally. You don’t know what happened, or who you’re competing against. If a company doesn’t see your value, that doesn’t mean you have none. Realise that you are a work in progress, and have confidence in your own strengths, as well as your ability to grow over time. Rejection is something that raises anxiety, but it actually represents a very valuable chance to grow, and shouldn’t be feared.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantity and Quality.</strong> Apply for as many jobs related to your field as you can. Send applications to jobs you don’t even think you’re qualified to do. Even if success is extremely unlikely, you will learn a lot from any interviews you get, and from the rejections. So find a place where jobs in your field are posted (for me it was LinkedIn), put aside some time in your schedule (for me it was 10am every day, after most jobs seemed to be posted), and spend at least 1 hour just sending applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cover letter and CV.</strong> Have these ready to send. Learn what your strengths are and emphasise them on these documents. Send the same CV and Cover Letter with 90% of your applications (so that you can scale the process and apply faster to more companies), and adapt them slightly for 5–10% of job applications where the job seems perfect for you. On these more specific versions, emphasise how you would be a good fit based on the qualities and skills specified in the job description.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on your personal growth.</strong> This is key. Unless you’re lucky enough to go directly from University to your Dream Job, the transitory period between University and Employment is and should be a time of immense growth. Put aside time to increase your  professional skills so that you will have more to tell potential employers (they want to know that you are the kind of person who takes initiative). At the same time, maintain a balance in your life — exercise, eat healthy, and spend time with people who love you. Meditate and try to understand yourself better. Be nice to yourself. When interviewers meet you, they want to meet the best version of you, so during the job–seeking process it’s important to find a way of living that brings out the best in you (actually, it’s important to do this always).</li>

                It’s true that some people do get a job in their preferred industry after university without breaking a sweat, but as I found out, that wouldn’t be the case for me. I certainly didn’t make things easy for myself by moving during a pandemic to a new country where I wasn’t fluent in the language, something that screened me out of many of the opportunities before they even started. But I believe that the fact that things did come together for me after what was a very stressful and uncertain experience really speaks volumes about the power of relentless optimism. My message to people who are or will be in a similar situation to me is this: keep going. Persevere, do what you have to do to keep your dream alive, give yourself both the chance to become the person that companies want to hire, and the time to learn how to show them that you are that person they want on their team.
