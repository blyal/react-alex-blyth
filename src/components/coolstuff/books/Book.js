                            'Within two pages of reading this book, I was laughing out loud. Notes from Underground is a very dark comedy following a bitter, lonely man’s half-arsed attempt to reconnect with humanity.',
                            'Dostoevsky is an incredibly astute observer of human behaviour, thought, and motivation. Whereas most people see the world as they’d like it to be, Dostoevsky sees it as it actually is — or, to my mind, gets closer than almost anyone. The narrator in this book is such a loser, but he’s such a real loser. His resentful thought patterns are so realistic, and when you read this book you will laugh at yourself because you will definitely find echoes of some bitter and nonsensical thoughts you’ve had yourself in your less fine moments. The narrator seems like a caricature, like his characterisation is taken to an extreme, but then again I don’t know… we humans do get very resentful.',
                            'It’s a fantastic book, it’s not too long, it’s full of insight. A great introduction to Dostoevsky.'

                            'There’s something so hypnotic about Murakami’s writing. There are lots of books in the world which I can’t read because they’re just too damn boring, but Murakami never fails to hold my attention, to keep me wanting to come back for more. Norwegian Wood is probably the thing of his I’ve enjoyed the most. Most of his stories deal with love triangles alongside ambiguously supernatural occurrences… this book ditches the supernatural and just deals straight with the love triangle. It’s very touching, it’s poignant, it’s real, it feels important. You will find a lot to connect to in this book. I also really like how it’s named after a Beatles song, it’s cool how Murakami likes the Beatles. The Beatles are awesome.'
