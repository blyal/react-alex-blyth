            <h3>The Tim Ferriss Show</h3>
            <a href="https://tim.blog" target="_blank">https://tim.blog</a>
            <p>Tim Ferriss is an entrepreneur, angel investor, author, and podcaster who has achieved massive success in all of these fields.
                In his podcast, it is his job, in his own words, to "deconstruct world-class performers from eclectic areas to extract the tactics, tools, and routines you can use. This includes favorite books, morning routines, exercise habits, time-management tricks, and much more."
                Ferriss has interviewed everyone, from actors such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, to CEOs such as Disney's Bob Iger, to meditation teachers such as Tara Brach, to psychtherapists such as relationship coach Esther Perel.

                I've been a listener of this podcast for over five years now, and I would say that it has had a huge impact on my life. I was really lucky to be introduced to it at a really formative time in my life, so as to be able to incorporate and adopt many of the tools and routines that Ferriss uncovers from his guests.
                Ferriss is something of a selfâ€“experimenter, having personally tried many of these tools and routines himself.
                He is also an promoter of human wellbeing, and his podcast and writings could be seen as a gift to anyone who reaches out to take it.
                His fascination with being able to maximise your chances of success, in all different domains, has allowed people the chance to change life outcomes by adding or changing different personal ingredients and methods.
